# ðŸ‘¾ Minimal Neovim Config
This is a **minimal but functional** [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) configuration, specially designed for **remote server** environments where only essential features are needed to stay productive.

---

## Installation

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
cd ~/.config
git clone https://github.com/julian-bc/nvim.git
```

Neovim will automatically use it the next time you open `nvim`.
